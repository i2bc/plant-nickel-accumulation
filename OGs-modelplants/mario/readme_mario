MaRiO: Meta-approach of prediction of ortholog groups
Cécile PEREIRA
Version 1.1; 27 june 2014
-----------------------------------------

MaRiO is a software implementing a meta-approach of prediction of ortholog groups.
The meta-approach trick the result of several methods in order to obtain specific 
intersections, create relevant profile HMMs and add to this intersections 
sequences coherent with the profile HMMs.

The method is describe in the paper : 
Cécile Pereira, Alain Denise and Olivier Lespinet, A Meta-approach for improving the 
prediction and the functional annotation of ortholog groups. (journal) 

------------------------------------------

These are installation instructions.
Starting from a source distribution, MaRiO-1.1.tar.gz
 uncompress			tar -xcvf MaRiO-1.1.tar.gz
 move into new directory:	cd MaRiO-1.1

The main perl script : MaRiO.pl .
The folder with other scripts are in SCRIPTS .
The folder with test dataset is DATA .
Perl library are in the folder MaRiO-1.1/SCRIPTS/perl_library/ .
It's possibly to install them or to precise the folder containing them with the perl -I option.
HMMER and Muscle have to be installed.

Testing the program (folder in the ~ directory):
perl -I ~/SCRIPTS/perl_library/ MaRiO.pl -i ~/MaRiO-1.1/DATA/Groups/ -f ~/MaRiO-1.1/DATA/Proteomes/ -cpu 1  >>MaRiO.out 2>> MaRiO.err


---------------------------------------------------------------
Using MaRiO:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Fallowing library and programs have to be installed:
        perl library (use cpan for the installation):   Math::Combinatorics, 
                                                        Cwd,  
                                                        Bio::SeqIO,  
                                                        File::Basename, 
                                                        File::Spec, 
                                                        XML::Simple 
							Parallel::ForkManager
        programs : muscle, HMMER

Parameters :
-h      print the help
-i      folder where are stored homolog groups to combine
                one file by input method (put at least the result of 2 methods)
                two files format allowed
                1) orthoXML format : description at http://orthoxml.org/
                   file name have to be ended by '.xml'
                   Noted that if the file contain paires and not groups, groups will be made as 
                   ensemble of proteins with a relation of orthology with all other proteins in the same group
                2) "groups" format : one line by group
                                     protein names separed by a ';'
-f      folder containing proteomes sequences files both fasta files or seqXML files are allowed, 
                warning: use one fasta file by specie
                sequences files in seqXML: file name have to be ended by '.xml'
                sequences files in fasta format: fine name have to be ended by '.fa'
-res	result folder, default parameter : RESULTS_metOG_date/
-tmp	tempory folder, default parameter : TMP_metOG_date/
-inter  minimum size of the selected intersections for the creation of intermediate groups
                default parameter : 4
-e      e-value threshold, default parameter : 1e-10
-pa     aligment percentage threshold, default parameter : 40 
-cpu    number of used cpu, default parameter : 1

Examples : 
perl -I ~/SCRIPTS/perl_library/ MaRiO.pl -i ~/INPUT_GROUPS/ -f ~/FASTA_PROTEOMES/ -cpu 6  >>MaRiO.out 2>> MaRiO.err

Results :
Results are ortholog groups prediction. This results are saved in the -res folder.
Two formats are given:
	fasta format :	 	Groups in fasta format are saved in FINAL_GROUPS.bz2
				One file by group. 
				Proteins in the group are listed in fasta format:
				">protein id \t specie \n sequence"
	orthoXML format : 	All predicted groups are saved in one file in orthoXML format.
				See the description of the format at http://orthoxml.org/

The both formats are two way to presenting the same information, take into account the one you prefer.
